# **Career and Practical Advice**

# Purpose

- Students and other people who review my online profiles sometime ask me advice about careers (e.g., getting a "good" job in analytics) or what types of skill/knowledge they should purpose.

- I decided to start this post to document questions and responses as these come up

## Disclaimer 

- This is of course just my advice based on my life and my experiences.  I may very well be wrong!  Or maybe my advice does not apply to your sitation!  

- But I offer what I believe could help at least some people.  Please respond to me and let me know what you think!


# Is A Certificate Program "Worth It"?

- It depends on your career goals, your finances, and how much time you have (among other things)

- But of course, I would in general say "yes"!  Analytics skills (especially in healthcare) are still in high demand.  Depending on your existing skills and knowledge, a certificate program could be an good value proposition.  

   - I believe that are UCD program is priced at a reasonable level, and thus you can get knolwedge and proof of the knolwedge without a huge expenditure 

# What Is the Difference Between Data Scientists and Data Analysts?

- In my idea, the term "data scientist" gets hyped up a bit.  
- Without going into all of the details, a data scientist at Google, Facebook, or a big tech group might get paid a ton of money, have a PhD in math from MIT, and run neural network models

- As another example, I met a young person who was doing manual data entry into an Excel spreadsheet, and with this position, she called herself a "data scientists"  

- Rather than get too worried about status competition, and other arguments, I think I have learned one truth.   There is a LOT of work to be done preparing, organizing, querying, and curating data.  There is a huge demand for people who can process and organize data given that most datasets and database are complex 

- My HCA class teaches this "data wraggling".  It may not be the highest status work, but the pay if often good 

# What Programming Language is Most Important in Healthcare 

- SQL and Python.   Learn these 

- SAS is still used, and R is also common and powerful 

# What Do Employers Need?

- Health analytics is a problem orriented field.  Employeers need people who can learn about what problems need to be solved, document possible solutions, and them implement some programming / analytics to help

- Employers do not simply want programmers.  The valuable people are those who can communicate and work in a team to solve problems 

- Often "tech" or "IT" people are not the best communicators, or are not interested to write or respond to questions, concerns, complaints.  If you can write and speak, make sure your interview panel knows this!

#  Writing 

- Written communication is critical. Those who can write, will find a niche for themselves in IT and analystics, because the "data gurus" sometimes think the story or the fun is in the data. Nope.  The output is the interpretation of the data, and communicating what was learned, and how data + models can help!
