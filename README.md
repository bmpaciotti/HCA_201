# HCA 201: Healthcare Data Acquisition and Management 

 ### https://cpe.ucdavis.edu/section/healthcare-data-acquisition-and-management 

## In this respository I have shared some example SQL queries written in the MySQL dialect 

## Please use these examples for the assignments. Please note, however, be that the examples could have a few bugs and may not always be a clear path to answer every assignment question.  Thus, I encourage you to use these queries as examples:  please edit, test, share, and ask questions!

## The OMOP Common Data Model is used by many organizations around the world.  The OHDSI community and other groups share OMOP queries and use cases. You are welcome to find and use other sources; just reference where you got your example query

## You are encouraged to start with existing queries, especially if you are struggling with SQL programming.  However, to learn SQL you need to practice writing some SQL.  Thus, push yourself to modify example queries, or build off of simpler queries
